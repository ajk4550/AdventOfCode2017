## Description

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

## Notes

My approach to this project focused less on optimization and more on exploration. I am attempting to use a new programming language each day which is a challenge. Also since the goal is to get the answer and not to have a program that is re-usable, optimization was less important than solving the puzzles in new ways or in programming languages that I've never used before. If any of this code were to be used in production, it would be re-evaluated for programming principles and optimization methods.

## Puzzles

1. **Captcha Test** - Solve a captcha puzzle to prove that you are **NOT** human.
2. **Checksum calculation** - Calculate the checksum of a modeled spreadsheet based on the given checksum specifications
3. **Spiral Memory** - Calculate the Manhattan Distance from a point to the center of an Ulam spiral. Still in Progress. I've completed the first part and will need to come back to part 2.
4. **Unique Password Count** - Given a list of pass phrases, count the number of valid passwords based on security protocol. Part 1 specifies the words have to all be unique, part 2 specifies the words cannot be anagrams of each other.
5. **Instruction Set Jump** - Given a list of jumps, navigate outside of the list. The jumps can be negative or positive. Each time you leave a pointer, increment it by 1 until you are able to escape the jump list.
